Throughout her undergraduate journey, her appreciation for computational design and manufacturing strengthened, leading her toward the exciting space of 3D printing, otherwise known as Additive Manufacturing (AM). For AM, the usual limitations of conventional manufacturing are eliminated, meaning almost any design idea can be fabricated, widening the scope of viable engineering solutions. Buying into its potential, Arielle decided to contribute to the advancement of AM technology through the pursuit of a PhD research opportunity at the University of Nottingham where she later met her co-founders.
